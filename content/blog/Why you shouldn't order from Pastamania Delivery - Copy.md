This was until I realized that the folks at Pastamania doesn't give a hoot about protecting it's customers login data.

[Pastamania](http://pastamaniadelivery.sg) stores your password as plain text and doesn't care about security, period.

I used to be a loyal Pastamania customer and orders from Pastamania frequently. This was until I realized that the folks at Pastamania doesn't give a hoot about protecting it's customers login data.

So one day I tried to change my password on Pastamania's site and guess what? Their email responder sents me a confirmation email with my new password in plain text ...

Furthermore, they didn't force SSL for logins

Of course I did dropped them an email to notify about this issue.

To which they acknowledged it.

However it's more than 4 months now and they're still storing my password in plain text.

**Why should you care?**  
Most users use the same username and password for logins across various sites. The problem is that it only takes a site like Pastamania Delivery to be compromised for a hacker to have access to all your logins on other sites.


**What can you do about this?**  
I highly recommend password management tool like [Lastpass](https://lastpass.com/). When you use LastPass, your passwords are protected by a master password (which you need to remember) and encrypted locally. LastPass has a form filler that automates password entering and form filling. This makes it easy for you to maintain different login credentials across various sites.

If you want to add another layer of security, you can use [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com) together with Lastpass. Yubikey is popularly used by some of the [biggest companies on the internet](https://www.yubico.com/about/reference-customers/).
